# StaticCodeAnalyzer
Project of Python Core track at hyperskill.org

### About.
In this project, you will create a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code. You will get a general idea of static code analysis and expand your competence in Python.

### Learning outcomes
After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of how static source code analyzers work. You will also get more experience with object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and file processing. You will practice using the abstract syntax tree, and, last but not least, learn more about the rules of Python code style.
